1. Pair Program - build and test
1. Create GitHub accounts
1. Read / analyze Game Lab version that is close to the Unity tutorial
1. C# vs. JavaScript  
JavaScript was designed to make it writing programs relatively easy, C# was designed to make it easy (well easier) to write *reliable* programs. Some of the differences between C# and JavaScript are:
