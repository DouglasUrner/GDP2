## Stages (and assignments)

### Design & Planning

* Identify the elements & mechanics of the game.
* Instantiate the elements:
  - Background
  - Paddles
  - Ball
  - Boundaries
  - Display the score

  - Move paddles
    - Prevent from leaving screen
  - Move the ball
  - Bounce the ball off of the paddles
  - Bounce the ball off of the walls
  - Score when ball hits back walls
  - Start game / end game / restart game

### Pair Programming in Game Lab (JavaScript)

* Pair Program - build and test
* Create a "released" game

### Lesson on development tools & the Game Lab game engine model

### Differences between JavaScript & C#

JavaScript was designed to make it writing programs relatively easy, C# was designed to make it easy (well easier) to write *reliable* and *maintainable* (easier to read and change) programs. Some of the differences between C# and JavaScript are:
* Types
* Objects
* Storage
   
### Git & GitHub

* Create GitHub accounts

### Unity Introduction

1. Read / analyze Game Lab version that is close to the Unity tutorial
1. Meet Unity  
Unity is an *integration tool* for assembling the pieces necessary to create 2D and 3D interactive experiences like games, and also simultators, visualizations (building interiors), etc. To get started we want to become familiar with:
   - Match UI to the layout being used in the tutorial
1. Commit regularly
