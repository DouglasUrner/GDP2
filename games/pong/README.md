# Pong

## Objectives

* Identify the elements and mechanics of a simple game.
* Review programming basics
  - Syntax
  - Functions
  - Conditionals/Booleans
  - Sprites
  - Collisions
  - Patterns
* Pair programming
* Note taking

## Stages (and assignments)

### Design & Planning

* Identify the elements & mechanics of the game.
* Instantiate the elements:
  - Background
  - Paddles
  - Ball
  - Boundaries
  - Display the score
* Implementing the mechanics:
  - Move paddles
    - Prevent from leaving screen
  - Move the balls
  - Bounce the ball off of the paddles
  - Bounce the ball off of the walls
  - Score when ball hits back walls
  - Start game / end game / restart game

### Pair Programming in Game Lab (JavaScript)

0. Design
   - Identify elements & mechanics
   - Plan structure of the code - identify little pieces to build and test.
1. Pair Program - build and test
1. Create GitHub accounts
1. Read / analyze Game Lab version that is close to the Unity tutorial
1. C# vs. JavaScript  
JavaScript was designed to make it writing programs relatively easy, C# was designed to make it easy (well easier) to write *reliable* programs. Some of the differences between C# and JavaScript are:
   - Types
   - Objects
   - Storage  
1. Meet Unity  
Unity is an *integration tool* for assembling the pieces necessary to create 2D and 3D interactive experiences like games, and also simultators, visualizations (building interiors), etc. To get started we want to become familiar with:
   - Match UI to the layout being used in the tutorial
1. Commit regularly
