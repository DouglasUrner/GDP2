## Prototype

Your prototype should demonstrate a **testable** portion of your game - **and** a milestone on your work breakdown. In other words, you should be able to demonstrate that you are working your plan and that you have some progress to show for your work. The reality of developing a substantial software project often means that plans have to be adjusted - that's to be expected - but it also means that your milestones, work breakdown, and individual tasks must be adjusted to reflect the adjustments.

### Learning Targets:

* I can break a complex task down into component parts.
* I can revise my plans as I encounter problems/challenges.
* I can use a source code management system to track changes and collaborate with my team.

## Instructions

1. Make sure that your milestones & work breakdown are up to date and reflect your work on the project.
1. Make sure that the version of your project on GitHub is current and that the prototype is on the active branch (typically this would be your master or development branch).
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template], rename it so that it is clear that it is your working document.
1. Make a screen capture of running prototype and paste it into the template, then respond to the questions.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
