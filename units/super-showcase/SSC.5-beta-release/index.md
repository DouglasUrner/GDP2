### Learning Targets:

* I can build a web deployable version of a Unity game.
* I can fork a GitHub repository.
* I can create a pull request on GitHub.

## Instructions

You can find more detail in the [slides][].

1. Build a WebGL version of your game.
1. While Unity is building your game, plan your playtest questions. Each member of the team should add questions about their work.
1. Test the build in your browser.
1. After resolving any problems, push the changes to GitHub.
1. Go to the [GDP-Playtest][gdp-playtest] repository on GitHub and make a fork of it.
1. Clone the fork to your computer.
1. Experiment with the repository in your browser (especially **index.md**) to see how it works, you can also look at the [live site](https://douglasurner.github.io/GDP-Playtest/) - it should be close to identical what you see on GitHub.
1. Copy the **Build** folder from your game to the **Games/2018-2019** folder in the cloned GDP-Playtest repository.
1. Rename the folder to match the name of your game.
1. Push your changes back to GitHub.
1. On GitHub, edit the **index.md** to add a link to your game and add your questions.
1. Create a pull request for me to merge in your changes (which will make your game and questions visible).
1. Make a copy of the [template][] and list the feedback that **you** would like from the playtest.
1. Submit the template and go on to the [playtest][].
