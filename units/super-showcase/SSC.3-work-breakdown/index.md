## Work Breakdown

### Milestones

Big projects are easier to tackle if they are broken down into managable hunks. For this project the end goal is a prototype that lets testers experience a "vertical slice" of your game. So the first task is to identify the milestones along the way from your game concept to your prototype. Here are some things to think about and do:

* Start by sketching out the story or the objective of the game - what is the game about? This is almost certianly the first milestone.
* Once you know what the game in about you can proceed to defining the *core mechanic* of the game - your next milestone is probably to get the game to a point where you can test the core mechanic. Anything not essential to proving that you have a good core mechanic can wait (or happen in parallel). How does the protagonist navigate the game world? What do they do and encounter as the game progresses?
* With the core mecanic working, add a secondary mechanic or two - how does the protagonist interact with the things they encounter?
* What happens if the encounter goes well? If it goes badly?
* What ends the game?
* What will your opening screen look like (and what is a simple placeholder that you can start with) and what do you do to move past it?
* What do the winning and losing screens look like (again, think about simple placeholders).
* How will you do your credits.

You should also start a resources list. It may be a good idea to have someone in your group who is responsible for collecting them and adding them to the master repository.

Make estimates about how long you think it should take to reach each milestone.

### Task Lists

With your milestones in place, breakdown them down into tasks that need to be accomplished to reach the milestone. Assign the tasks to members of the group.

### Learning Targets:

* I can identify milestones that mark progress towards completing a project.
* I can list the tasks (accomplishments) that go into achieving a milestone.
* I can break a task into a set of smaller steps.

## Instructions

1. Have one person in your team make a copy of the [workbreakdown template][template] and add a link to it in the project README on GitHub. If you don't remember how to add a link in a [Markdown][] document, go back to the SSC.1 assignmnent and look a how you created the link to the Game Design Document.
1. Also share it with the members of your team.
1. With your team fill in the milestones and start assigning the tasks that are necessary to reach them.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
