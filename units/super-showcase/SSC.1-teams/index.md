## Setting Up Teams

For the **Game Design Super Showcase Competition** your team may have up to five people. Your first task is to pick your collaborators and set up a repository on GitHub to hold your team's work on the game. Then we'll create a new Unity project and practice working collaboratively with a body of code.

The process that we're using is described on the [Unity and GitHub][how-to-github] page in the class Resources module on Canvas.
