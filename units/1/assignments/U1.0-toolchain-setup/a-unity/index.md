## Toolchain: Unity

[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11rmWFCAxk_sEiLdIEvhSGuW5QFodw8ZB68lq56WcsSo/edit?usp=sharing
[template]: 

The first step in setting up our toolchain will be Unity.

[Slides: **Toolchain: Unity**][slides] - right-click and choose **Open link in a new tab** to view.

### Learning Targets:

* I can follow a sequence of instructions to setup Unity & create a Unity ID.
* I can use the Snipping Tool to make a screen capture on Windows.
* I can describe success - or the problems encountered - when following a process.

## Instructions

### On School Computers

Unity is installed on our lab computers. Follow along with the slides to:

1. Create a Unity ID.
1. Set the default folder where your Unity projects are saved.
1. Check, and if necessary set, the "external script editor" - the program used to edit the C# code for your Unity projects.

Finally make a copy of the [submission template][template] (right click and choose **Open link in a new tab**) and fill it in.

### On A Personal Computer

On other computers you'll need to start by downloading and installing the latest version of Unity. Then you'll need to set the default folder and the external script editor as we did in class.

## Submission

A PDF of the [submission template][template] through Canvas **do not** submit by sharing the document. Do this in class even if you plan to setup Unity at home.
