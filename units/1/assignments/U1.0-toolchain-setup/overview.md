## Setting Up Your Toolchain

A *toolchain* is the set of applications that you will be using as you work on a project. We're about to make the leap into hyperspace - going from Game Lab which was created to make it easy to learn the concepts of programming through games to Unity which was created to make creating "real" games a bit easier. Actually Unity makes it a *lot* easier, but it is still quite a leap from Game Lab. We'll try to take it easyâ€¦

Our toolchain consists of four big components:

1. **Unity** - Unity is a *game engine* and a graphical editor for assembling games. The Unity editor saves us a lot of coding, but there is still a lot of code to be written. For that we need a *text editor* of some sort, the one we'll be using is called Rider.
1. **Jetbrains Rider** - Rider is an *integrated development environment* (IDE) for writing programs in a language called **C#** (pronounced "C Sharp"). C# has a lot in common with JavaScript, but it also has some big differences. Probably the biggest difference is that it is a text only language - there are no blocks to be dragged around, all of the code is typed in. Rider has some nice features to make that easier and to help with getting the syntax right. You'll probably notice right away that C#'s error messages are much clearer than the ones we got from JavaScript. But we're definitely going to make mistakes. That's where Git and GitHub come in.
1. **Git** and **GitHub** - Git is a *distributed revision control system* - a tool for keeping track of changes to code. With Git you can see what changed between two versions (Git calls them *commits*). It also lets you go back to an earlier version. **GitHub** is a place to keep your code. With GitHub, your code lives "in the cloud" (i.e., on someone else's computer). The great thing about GitHub is that it makes the problem of collaborating with someone(s) on a coding project *much* easier. It also makes it easy to "take you code home" to work on it.
1. **Piskel** - Piskel is the sprite editor that you used with Game Lab. It is also available as a web application.

First we will get all of these tools set up and working together here in the lab. All of them are available for "free" for student use, so you can also install them at home as well.
