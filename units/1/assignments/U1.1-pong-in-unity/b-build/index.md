After you have decided which tutorial you will use, it is time to start in. Since the tutorials build on each other, you may want to refer to the other tutorials. The initial steps of the first tutorial are especially useful as you learn your way around Unity and C#. They are all linked here:

* [Tutorial 1: Building A Pong Prototype][noobtuts]
* [Tutorial 2: Turning the Prototype Into A Playable Game][awesome]
* [Tutorial 3: A Complete Game With An AI][quarles1]
* [Tutorial 4: Retro Pong With An AI][quarles2]

Once you have your tutorial under way, make an initial commit of your code to GitHub.
