# Building Pong in Unity

## Tutorial Options

* [Noobtuts: Unity 2D Pong Game][noobtuts] - this is a great place to start if you haven't worked with Unity before. You build a Pong prototype with the basic gameplay, but no scoring. It includes an introduction to working with Unity.
* [Awesome Inc U: Make A Pong Game With Unity 2D][awesome] - start here if you are up for a bit more challenge (or skip to here after doing the first section of the Noobtuts tutorial). You will build a complete game with scoring and a restart button. Stop when you have a working game in Unity, we will build a deployable game together as a later assignment.
* [Vincent Quarles][quarles]: Building a Pong Clone in Unity - this is the most complex of the tutorials. You will build a complete single player game with a small menu system and an AI.
