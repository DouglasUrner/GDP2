# Pong In Unity

## Level 1: A Minimal Prototype

### Objectives:

* Start a new Unity project.
* Test a game you are developing.
* Save changes to a Unity project.
* Create game objects by placing sprites in the Hierarchy and Scene views.
* Move game an object by directly manipulating its transform.
* Attach components to game objects.
* Create C# scripts and attach them to game objects.
* Use `public` fields to configure components in the Inspector.
* Explain the purpose and common settings of the Rigidbody2D component.

### Milestones:

* Start a new project.
* Collect, organize, and import the image assets for sprites.
* Set up the walls and centerline.
* Create the paddle sprites and get them moving.
* Create the ball sprite and get it moving.
* Make the ball bounce off of the walls.
* Make the ball bounce off of the paddles.

### Playtest:

* How does the game feel?
  - How are the sizes of the ball, paddle, and the "table"?
  - How is the movement of the paddles and the ball? Do they feel right? What would you change?
  - Experiment with adjusting the `ballSpeed` and `paddleSpeed` properties. What values seem right? What makes them right?
* Where could you add strategy to the game?
  - Give the players a way to effect the direction of the ball after they hit it?
    - Where the ball hits the paddle.
    - Movement of the paddle when the ball hits.
* What could you do to keep the game interesting and challenging?
  - Have ball speed up?
  - More than one ball at a time?
