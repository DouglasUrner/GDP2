## Recreating Pong in Game Lab

![](https://media.wired.com/photos/59fccff22d3f5732c7d5aa15/master/w_582,c_limit/Pong-TA-B1C1YX.jpg){: width="200"}

We're going to get started by designing and building a faithful recreation of the clasic arcade game [Pong][pong] in [Game Lab][gamelab] - this will serve as a review and will help make sure that we have a shared piece of code to refer to when we move on to C# and Unity.

If you haven't worked in Game Lab before, you'll need to set up an account. It's easy:

1. Go to the [HelloID portal][helloid] (right-click on the link or type in the URL helloid.skschools.org).
1. Find the Code.org button and click on it.
1. Accept the terms of service and privacy policy.
1. On the Code.org dashboard, click on the Projects button in the navigation bar.
1. In the projects view, select Game Lab - you may also want to bookmark the Projects page.

The project is broken into three phases:

1. [Select a partner][pigl-1] (singular) to team with as you build a Pong clone.
1. [Planning][pigl-2] your version of Pong with a partner.
1. Pair-programming with a partner to [build the code that you planned][pigl-3].
1. [Setting goals][pigl-4].

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain the practice of "pair programming."
* I can explain the concept of "abstraction" as it is used in computer science.
* I can explain what computer scientists mean by the term "algorithm."
* I can break a large problem into smaller component parts.
* I can construct an algorithm using the building blocks of:
  - Sequencing (arranging steps in order)
  - Selection (choosing which branch of code to follow)
  - Iteration (looping over a set of instructions)
