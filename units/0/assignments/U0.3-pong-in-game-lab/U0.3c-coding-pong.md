## Coding Pong

Once you have a plan, it is time to start building your game.

### Learning Targets:

* I can create and instantiate sprites.
* I can make a sprite move using the counter pattern or the velocity properties.

## Instructions

One way to approach building the game is to:

1. Create the visual elements of the game - the ball, the paddles, maybe a background.
1. Write the code to position and display them. Test it.
1. Make the ball move.
1. Make the ball bounce off the "walls."
1. Implement the player controls - one at a time.
1. Make the ball bounce off the paddles.
1. Implement scoring.
