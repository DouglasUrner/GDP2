Once you have your partner selected, take some time to plan out how you will approach the game. Start by taking some individual time to sketch out ideas in your notes the use the [Pong Planning Template][template] to record your ideas.

[Slides: Planning Pong][slides] - right-click and choose **Open link in a new tab** to view.

### Learning Targets:

* I can identify the elements of an electonic game.
* I can describe the interactions between the elements.

## Instructions

1. Make an editable copy of the [Planning Pong Template][template].
1. Looking at your notes and confering with your partner, fill in as much of it as you can.
   - You may find that there are parts that you aren't sure how to answer completely at this stage. That is fairly common, but you should have *some* ideas in each section.
   - At this point you and your partner may not see eye-to-eye on how (or maybe what) to implement the game.
1. Once you have completed the [template][], move on to the next step [Coding Pong][pigl-3]

## Submission

Each member of the team should submit PDF of their planning document through Canvas **do not** submit by sharing the document. Make sure to move the bookmark in your planning notes.
