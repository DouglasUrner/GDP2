## Pong Playtest

Once your game is in a playable state, add a link to your game to the [Pong Playtest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17maAJapIEmMKpeymQTe1USvwT3KDaPC5Fy71ABeakj0/edit?usp=sharing) document.

Then, make yourself a copy of the [Pong Feedback Template][template] and playtest **at least** four of your classmates' games (unless, of course, there are not four classmates who have submitted games - then just test the ones that are available). Fill in the template as you test. After playing, find one or both of the creators of each game that you played and give them the feedback that they requested.

## Submission

Submit your completed [Pong Feedback Template][template] on Canvas.
