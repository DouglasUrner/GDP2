## Recreating Pong in Game Lab

We're going to get started by designing and building a faithful recreation of the clasic arcade game [Pong][pong] in [Game Lab][gamelab] - this will serve as a review and will help make sure that we have a shared piece of code to refer to when we move on to C# and Unity.

The project is broken into three phases:

1. [Planning]() your version of Pong with a partner.
1. Pair-programming with a partner to [build the code that you planned]()
1. [Setting goals]()
