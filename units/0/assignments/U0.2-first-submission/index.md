## Canvas 101

The purpose of this assignment is to help you become familiar with Canvas and how to submit Google Docs assignments. It will also provide you with a chance to review your feedback on the assignment and to, if necessary, resubmit the assignment. Most assignments can be resubmitted to improve your score - the window for resubmission varies, so be sure to check.
