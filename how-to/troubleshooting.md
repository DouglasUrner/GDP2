# Troubleshooting

## LanSchool is blocking private browsing

**Cause:** This seems to happen when you are running the Edge or Internet Explorer (IE) browsers. It may also happen if you either of those are set as your default browser.

**Solution:** Close Edge or IE if they are open. If you have no open browsers, launch Chrome and check for the "Chrome is not your default browser..." message and set your default browser to Chrome. If this does not fix the problem, please tell me so that we can track down what is happening.
